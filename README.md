# Python for Scientists (py4sci)

This is a Python introduction guide target to scientific applications. The idea is to provide a guide tutorial divided by subjects to aid my workmates @ [ICFO](https://www.icfo.eu/) to learn Python by put hands on. 

## TL;DR  

These guides notebooks are not meant to be a lecture but a collection of illustrative short piece of commented codes, which one can run and modify locally. Details will be provided by recommended further readings on each notebook.

## Index

Inside folder **docs** you'll find all guide notebooks, as follow:

```python
docs
├── 0-Installation.ipynb
├── 1-Basics.ipynb
├── 2-Plot.ipynb
└── 3-Fitting.ipynb (coming soon)
```

## Get Started

1. Install **Anacoda** - [0-Installation](https://github.com/leaxp/py4sci/blob/master/docs/0-Installation.ipynb) 

2. Download this repository: 
   `Clone or download` green button on top-right of this page  >  `Download ZIP`

3. Extract repository ZIP file

4. On Terminal (Anaconda prompt for Windows) command line, inside the extracted **py4sci-master** folder

   ```python
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Inside **docs** explore and run the guide notebooks

## Get Involved

Please don't leave alone! I would like to this to be a collaborative guide. We have different interest application to Python (plot graphs, fitting data, data mining, image analysis, ...) so please help me to complete this puzzle. Write a guide notebook contribution to add here. Send me an [email](mailto:alex.duarte@icfo.eu) with your GitHub username and I will add you as repository contributor.
